# Digital-Pressure-Gauge
  This Arduino code reads analog values from three pressure sensors 
  (oil, fuel, and a placeholder) and displays them on an OLED screen. 
  It also prints these values to the serial monitor. The OLED display 
  includes gauge representations for each pressure type. The code uses 
  the U8g2 library for OLED control and maps pressure values for dynamic 
  visualization.  This code is currently a work in progress, there may 
  be some errors or glitches.

I am using the following:

If you plan on using different products then you will need to modify the code accordingly.
